# Coffee Machine

This is my coding challenge submission for day #15 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

Welcome to the Coffee Machine! This program provides an interactive interface to allow customers to order and purchase coffee. We aim to provide the best customer experience, with quality ingredients and services to make sure everyone's coffee experience is satisfying.

## Installation

This program does not require any installation and is ready to use by running the `coffee_machine.py` file.


## Usage

The customer, upon running the program, will be prompted to what type of beverage they want to order. The available drinks are espresso, latte, and cappuccino. After selecting one, they will be asked to deposit coins and the machine will total the amount and print money subtracted, change returned, and a success or insufficient funds message. Lastly, the machine will produce the ordered beverage and the resources used to make it will be deducted from the resource pool.

If the customer requests "off", the machine will turn off, or they can request "report" to view the remaining resources, water, milk, coffee, and money earned.


Enjoy your coffee! ðŸ˜Š
